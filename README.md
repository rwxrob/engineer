# ðŸ˜Š Path to Joy and Happiness as an IT Engineer ðŸ“–

> "It may be the warriors who get the glory. But it's the engineers who
build societies." B'Elanna Torres:

The challenges of engineering certainly do not appeal to everyone. After
all, engineers are hopeless geeks who are constantly learning new
things, whether they want to or not, two hours of hard core research
every day is considered normal in this field. But, to those who feel the
call, the appeal is *very* real. Whether you want to build a new world,
or just make a lot of money, engineering has been providing
opportunities for both since humans have existed. Because the world
*wants* what engineers provide: power. There's a reason good engineers
are called "wizards." What they do seems like magic to everyone else.
But it's not magic, it's hard work, research, sweat, and lots of failure
leading to those few glorious successes. Engineers --- who are very much
scientists --- have invented everything important since the world began,
including modern plumbing, agriculture, refrigeration, beer, weapons,
medicine, software, space tech, and the Internet itself. Who *wouldn't*
want to be counted among them?

## What to get when?

3.  Install VMware Player and install different UNIX/Linux distros
4.  Install Podman Desktop and practice using Linux from containers
5.  Acquire an old or cheap laptop or desktop and install Linux
6.  Invest in a refurbished enterprise-grade Linux KVM VM host server
7.  Consider a cluster of K8S physical machines (refurbished Dell Optiplex)
